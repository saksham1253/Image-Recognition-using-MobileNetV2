# Image Recognition using MobileNetV2 with VOC2007 Dataset
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques for multi-label image classification using the VOC2007 dataset. The model is based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, which is fine-tuned to classify images into 20 object categories. Each image can contain multiple objects, making this a multi-label classification problem.


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict multiple object classes in an image from the VOC2007 dataset. The dataset includes 20 different object categories such as aeroplane, bicycle, dog, person, etc. The model uses transfer learning with MobileNetV2 and fine-tunes it on the VOC2007 dataset to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features
